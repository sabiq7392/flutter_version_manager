1. Copy and paste 'content' flutter_version.bash in .zshrc or .bash_profile
2. Adjust MAC_PATH, EX_PATH, EX_TOOLS_PATH, MAC_TOOLS_PATH with your location (i recommend you to make path same like me except the name of users (sabiqmuhammad))
3. source ~/.zshrc or source ~/.bash_profile
4. run command

example:
1. use_flutter_version 3.13.9
2. list_flutter_version
